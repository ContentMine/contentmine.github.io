Detailed instructions can be found at [github](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/tree/master/software-tutorials/ami)

You can actually run ami without calling norma first if you're just using xml papers downloaded from EuropePMC.

To run a default set of plugins simply type:

```cmine <folder name>```

This will give you html results tables in the project folder.

To add your own dictionaries use something of the form:

```cmine <folder name> word(search)w.search:/org/xmlcml/ami2/plugins/dictionary/tropicalVirus.xml```
