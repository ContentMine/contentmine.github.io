## What is ContentMine?
ContentMine aims to enable everyone to perform research using humanity’s accumulated scientific knowledge. We believe that “The Right to Read is the Right to Mine”: anyone who has lawful access to read the literature with their eyes should be able to do so with a machine. To make this a reality we are building software and training resources so that together we can liberate 100,000,000 facts from the scientific literature.

Peter Murray-Rust leads ContentMine as a Shuttleworth Foundation Fellow.
